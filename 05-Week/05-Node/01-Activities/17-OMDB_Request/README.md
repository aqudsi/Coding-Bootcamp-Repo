# OMDB Request

## File

* *None*

## Instructions

* Using the code sent to you earlier as a reference and using the code provided to you as a starter, create a Node application which takes in a movie name as a command line argument then uses the OMDB API to retrieve and return the release date to the console.

* For this activity you have two options:

  * Easier: Require that the user provide a movie with a single word in the title (ex: Cinderella)

  * Harder: Allow the user to provide a movie with as many words as possible (ex: Forrest Gump).

### Hints

* Start by figuring out what your API URL should be then use the starter code as a guide.

* Remember to `npm install request` or else your code will not work no matter what.

* Be sure to use an OMDB API Key with your request. You may use `40e9cece`.
