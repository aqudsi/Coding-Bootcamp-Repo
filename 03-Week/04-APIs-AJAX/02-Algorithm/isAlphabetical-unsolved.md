# Thursday Algorithm - isAlphabetical

### Question

###### isAlphabetical: Nikki, a queen of gentle sarcasm, loves the word `facetiously`. Lance helpfully points out that it is the only known English word that has _all five vowels_ in alphabetical order, and it even has a 'y' on the end! Nikki takes a break from debugging to turn and give him an acid state - indeed a look the was delivered `arseniously`. **Given a string, return whether all contained vowels are in _alphabetical_ order.**

####  _Ex: `isAlphabetical('arseniously') = true`_
####  _Ex: `isAlphabetical('bride') = false`_
