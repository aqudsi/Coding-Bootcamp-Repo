## Monday Algorithm - countZero

### Question

###### countZero: Count Total number of zeros from 1 up to n?

#### _Ex: countZero(2014) = 223_

###### _Explination:_ So the tick here is. if you have a number 1 to 50 the value is 5. just 50 divided by 10. However, if the value is 100. the value is 11. you will get by 100/10 = 10 and 10/10. Thats how you will get in the more zeros in one number like (100, 200, 1000)

### Setup
```
Function countZero(n){
