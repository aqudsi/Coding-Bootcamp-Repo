# Dain's Question

Your task (if you choose to accept it), Implement a class `Arith` to add two english words together!

For example:
```js
var k = new Arith("three");
k.add("seven"); //this should return "ten"
```

Set up:
```js
NUMBERS = ['zero','one','two','three','four','five',
           'six','seven','eight','nine','ten','eleven',
           'twelve','thirteen','fourteen','fifteen','sixteen',
           'seventeen','eighteen','nineteen','twenty']

class Arith{

}
```
#### Note:
- Input will be between zero and ten and will always be in lower case
- Output will be a word representation of the result of the addition. Should be in lower case
