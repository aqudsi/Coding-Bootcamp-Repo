# Andrea's Question

Your task (if you choose to accept it), is to implement a method that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The method should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.

For example:
```js
isTriangle(1,2,2) == true
isTriangle(7,2,2) == false
```

Set up:
```js
function isTriangle(a,b,c) {

}
```
