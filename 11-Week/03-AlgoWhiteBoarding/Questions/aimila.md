# Aimila's Question

Your task (if you choose to accept it), is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as a argument and return it with it's digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

For example:
```js
descendingOrder(21445) => 54421

descendingOrder(145263) => 654321

descendingOrder(1254859723) => 9875543221

```

Set up:
```js
function descendingOrder(n){

}
```
