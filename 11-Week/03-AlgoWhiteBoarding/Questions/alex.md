# Alex's Question

Your task (if you choose to accept it), is to flatten and sort an array.

Given a two-dimensional array of integers, return the flattened version of the array with all the integers in the sorted (ascending) order.

For example:
```js
function flattenAndSort([[3, 2, 1], [4, 6, 5], [], [9, 7, 8]]) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

Return value should contain a single array sorted with the contents of the array of array

Set up:
```js
function flattenAndSort(array) {
  
}
```

#### Notes
- Please, keep in mind, that JavaScript is by default sorting objects alphabetically.
