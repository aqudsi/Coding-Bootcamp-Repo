# Khiems's Question

Your task (if you choose to accept it), is to write a function that for every positive integer N, there exists a unique sequence starting with 1 and ending with N and such that every number in the sequence is either the double of the preceeding number or the double plus 1.

For example:
```js
climb(13) => [1,3,6,13]
// 3 = 2*1 + 1
// 6 = 2*3
// 13 = 2*6 + 1

```

Set up:
```js
function climb(n) {

}
```
