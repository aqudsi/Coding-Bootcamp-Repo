# Kieran's Question

Your task (if you choose to accept it), is to create bit calculator. Function arguments are two bit representation of numbers ("101","1","10"...), and you must return their sum in decimal representation.

For example:
```js
calculate("10","10") => 4
calculate("10","0") => 2
calculate("101","10") => 7
```

Set up:
```js
function calculate(str1, str2) {

}
```

#### Note:
- The only math functions you can use are: pow() , round(), random()
