# Eyob's Question

Your task (if you choose to accept it), is to write a function that given an initial string `s`, switch case of the minimal possible number of letters to make the whole string written in the upper case or in the lower case.

For example:
```js
caseUnification(abC) => 'abc'

caseUnification(ABc) => 'ABC'
```

Set up:
```js
function caseUnification(s) {

}
```

#### Note:
- Strings are all odd lengths consisting of English letters
- Strings are between 3 and 99, inclusive
