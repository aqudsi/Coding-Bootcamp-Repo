# Ahmer's Question

You have an array of numbers. Your task (if you choose to accept it) is to sort ascending odd numbers but even numbers must be on their places.

For example:
```js
sortArray([5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4]) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 5, 4]
```

Set up:
```js
function sortArray(array) {

}
```
#### Note: 
- Zero isn't an odd number and you don't need to move it. If you have an empty array, you need to return it.
