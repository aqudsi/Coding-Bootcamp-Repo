# Mahdia's Question

You are traveling in the amazon, and run into The Arara, an isolated tribe found in the Amazon who count in pairs.Your task (if you choose to accept it), is to write a function that converts base 10 number into Arera numbers.

```
1 = anane
2 = adak
3 = adak anane
4 = adak adak
5 = adak adak anane
6 = adak adak adak
7 = adak adak adak anane
8 = adak adak adak adak
```

For example:
```js
countArara(3) => 'adak anane'

countArara(8) => 'adak adak adak adak'
```

Set up:
```js
function countArara(n) {

}
```
