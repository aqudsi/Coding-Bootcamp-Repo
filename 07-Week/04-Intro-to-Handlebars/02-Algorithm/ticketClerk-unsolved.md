# Thursday Algorithm - ticketClerk

### Question

###### ticketClerk: The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. A "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.
###### Jake is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.
###### Can Jake sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line?
###### Return `YES`, if Jake can sell a ticket to each person and give the change. Otherwise return `NO`.

#### Example
``` JavaScript
tickets([25, 25, 50]) // => YES
tickets([25, 100])    // => NO. Jake will not have enough money to give change to 100 dollars   
```

### Setup
```JavaScript
line = [25, 25, 50]
function tickets(peopleInLine){
  //code
};
```
